   * Creates a usage record for a specified subscription item and date, and fills it with a

   * href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing">metered billing</a> plan,
   * Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.
   *
   * <p>The default calculation for usage is to add up all the {@code quantity} values of the usage
   * records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s
   * {@code aggregate_usage} <a
   * href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage">parameter</a>. When
   * there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the {@code quantity}
   * values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this
   * behavior with the {@code action} parameter.
   *
   * <p>The default pricing model for metered billing is <a
   * href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme">per-unit
   * pricing</a>. For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a <a
