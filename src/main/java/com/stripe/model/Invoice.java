/**
 * Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or
 * generated periodically from a subscription.
 *
 * <p>They contain <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems">invoice items</a>, and
 * proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
 *
 * <p>If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically
 * finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, <a
 * href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance">when automatic</a>, does
 * not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last
 * webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the
 * platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
 * creation to finalize the invoice.
 *
 * <p>If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your <a
 * href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic">email settings</a>, Stripe will
 * email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted
 * page to pay the invoice.
 *
 * <p>Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the
 * invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is
 * less than Stripe's <a
 * href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts">minimum allowed
 * charge per currency</a>, the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to
 * the customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
 *
 * <p>More details on the customer's credit balance are <a
 * href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance">here</a>.
