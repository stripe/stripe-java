* Change type of cvcCheck, addressZipCheck, and addressLine1Check
  attributes on com.stripe.model.Card. Values of those fields will be
  "pass", "fail", "unchecked", or null (github issue #11)

* Remove code and percentOff attributes from
  com.stripe.model.Discount. Stripe never returned these values for
  Discount objects, so they would previously always be null

* Add missing fields to Charge, Coupon, Discount, Event, and Invoice
  models (github issue #12)

* Include parameters passed to any object's delete method in actual
  API requests (github issue #10)

* Add new deleteDiscount method to com.stripe.model.Customer

* Numerous test suite improvements
